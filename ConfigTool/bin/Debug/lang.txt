txtParam6-tt=Delay until next activity cycle. Measured in minutes. Default is 1200 = 20 * 60, that is 20 hours. Upon completion of search time the beacon goes to sleep for a specified time period.  By default the beacon will wake up after every 24 hours since power on and will run for 4 hours.
label9=Sleep time, min
txtParam5-tt=Search period within which the timer-based beacon is active. Measured in minutes. Default is: 240 = 4*60, that is 4 hours. The beacon will be active within this time, increasing time interval between transmissions. In the beginning and at the end of the search period time interval is defined by corresponding parameters.
